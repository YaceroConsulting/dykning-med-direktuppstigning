# Dykning med direktuppstigning

This template leverages [Remix SPA Mode](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/spa-mode) and the [Remix Vite Plugin](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) to build your app as a Single-Page Application using [Client Data](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/client-data) for all of your data loads and mutations.

## Development

You can develop your SPA app just like you would a normal Remix app, via:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Production

When you are ready to build a production version of your app, `npm run build` will generate your assets and an `index.html` for the SPA.

```shellscript
npm run build
```


### Deployment

This application is deployed to GitHub Pages.
